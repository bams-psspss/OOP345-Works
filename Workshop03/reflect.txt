I declar that this submission is the result of my own work and I only copied the code

  In this workshop, I learn how to use string function and how it help us in coding. I learn that template could be anything and it is very convinient
if we want to use the same function, but different variables. I found it very annoying to include the template <typename T> everytime I create a function.
I know that we could just write the function body inside the class, but it is not really my style to that, so I just write all of the function with the template thing.
