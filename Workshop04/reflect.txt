I declare that this submission is the result of my own work and I only copied the code
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
This submitted piece of work has not been shared with any other student or 3rd party content provider.

	In this workshop, I learn how to use .find_first_not_of(); find_last_not_of(); I discover this 2 function when I was making a research how to trim the leading and trailing edge of the data. These two function find the first char if there is a blank space or not. If it does match it will return the index of that char, but if not it will return npos, which mean no position. 
	Next, the function .substr; This function receive 2 argument .substr(int x, int y), which x means the start of the string you want, and y is how many position you want the character.
	Continually, function .find(char x, int y); this function find the match char x in the string which start from the y position. This function will return the number of the index, if not found will return npos.
	Lastly, function .stoi(string sth); This function covert the string that have integral to the integer type and can be store in the integer type.
	
	The difficulty of this workshop is that to formatting the display in the console. I am not that confident to use setw without asking for help. But today I did research and have a review, so I think I understand more about it.
