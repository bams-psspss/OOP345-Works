I declare that this submission is the result of my own work and I only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments. This submitted piece of work has not been shared with any other student or 3rd party content provider.

	In this workshop is like a review OOP244. The new things I learn from this project is the new type called AUTO, which is a type that can change depend on the value of that variable. Next, the int main, before there is no argument in the in main, but now there is 2; argc and argv, which I also learn that argc is argument count and argv is argument value. Then comes the static. This variables is something really new for counting the number. The static I make a research and it divided into 3 types. I use Static local variables, which this variables lifetime will be there for entire runtime of the program, but it only limited to the function. They did not die after the functiuon is completed.

	In FoodOrder class2, the main part is I added the rule of three, because the change of m_descFood. It change from static to drynamic memory.
