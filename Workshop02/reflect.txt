I declar that this submission is the result of my own work and I only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments. This submitted piece of work has not been shared with any other student or 3rd party content provider.

  In this I expand my knowledege about string function, that sometime if I use it wrong everything in my files is gone. I also learn aboutthe chrono library, which converts time, or do anythin with time. For the fstream function, I quite not yet get it there, but I think I understand it more than before. Move Operator and move assignment operator is seems to be easy to me, but then I have many bug for deallocating the memory I use. Which I should probably go review it again, because of the mistake of freeing memeory, it cause my program to crash!
  In the function of operator[], I did try to have 1 return to be a good practice, but it seems I cannot do that, I cannot create a new string and give it an empty string and copy it. So I need to have 2 returns.
