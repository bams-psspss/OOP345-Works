Benefits of using the binary file is that, when you extract information from the file, you get the most accurate
data. They don't translate or converse anything from the file, but you get raw data, but the down part of storing 
raw data is that, you really need to be precise about storing them. In addition, it is more faster to read from 
binary file than the normal file, because it does not require to converse data like I mention above.

Using std::bind() is mainly to avoid repeated argument, which sometimes we can make mistake if we repeat
the code many times, and it is not good practice because of its readability. But the main reason of it is that
it simplified the thread functions.

Advantage of using multiple threads is that it increase the efficiency, responsiveness, and reduce execution time. By
using multiple thread, the program can execute many function at the same time, which reduce time in execution
