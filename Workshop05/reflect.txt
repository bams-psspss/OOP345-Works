I declare that this submission is the result of my own work and I only copied the code 
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments. 
This submitted piece of work has not been shared with any other student or 3rd party content provider.

	In this workshop, I learn more about the lambda expression when we want to have like a little function 
that we want to use it directly, we just create a lambda template above of what we were going to use.
	For the class Movie and Book, I would really use the inheritance. I will make a base class for both 
of them aand maybe name them like Base class, or another way, I could make a book as a base class 
and inherit in the Movie class. 
	In the main class there is constructor, and I don't think it need 
to be there. Because in my code I design it to already have the constructor, even if I don't have 
it, the compiler will automatically have make one by itslef, so I think it is uneccessary to have it there.
