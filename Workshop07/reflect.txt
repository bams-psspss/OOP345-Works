I declare that this submission is the result of my own work and I only copied the code 
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments. 
This submitted piece of work has not been shared with any other student or 3rd party content provider.
***********************************************************************/

List all the STL used in this Workshop:
iostream -> this STL used for the input and output
string -> for the variable member to store all the data from the bakery.txt file
iomanip -> this library is use to set the format for the output, such as setw and the precision for the price
algorithm -> this function use to manage the sorting part of this workshop
vector -> vector is the array that the size can be change and is use in this workshop to combine one output to another output
list -> list is use to return the out of stock items


Using the algorithm function makes my code looks cleaner and easier to read, but the down side of it is that, the function of the algorithm
is quit a limit to what I want to use. So in this workshop, I use both algorithm function and the function that I create on my own.

I don't think anything would be different if I change from vector to list. This two library is a little bit similar and would be easy  to implement,
or not changing much of code if vector was to change to list.
